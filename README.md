# Too Close for Comfort: The Effects of Crowding on the Behavioral and Physiological Stress Responses of Hemigrapsus Oregonensis

Rising sea levels and combatative shoreline armoring are compressing intertidal zones across the Pacific Northwest, reducing the amount of available habitat for native species. This "coastal squeeze" is particularly problematic for intertidal burrowers like Hemigrapsus oregonensis, a native decapod that relies on soft sediments and habitat complexity to avoid predation and manage physiological stress. As habitats shrink, population densities may rise, intensifying stress through crowding. While behavioral responses such as aggression have been documented in crustaceans, the physiological consequences of crowding remain less understood. This study investigated whether H. oregonensis exhibits behavioral (righting time) and physiological (respiration rate) stress responses to physical crowding and waterborne chemical cues from previously crowded conspecifics. We hypothesized that physical crowding would elevate metabolic activity and impair reflexes, and that chemical cues would produce weaker but detectable effects. A two-phase laboratory experiment was conducted using 18 crabs collected from a mixed-substrate shoreline in Puget Sound and placed in a control tank in natural substrate. In Phase 1, 9 crabs were assigned to a crowded treatment (~40 cm², 200 mL seawater) and 9 to an uncrowded treatment (~195 cm², 1000 mL). In phase 2, surviving crabs were reassigned: 8 crabs to the same crowded container (with fresh seawater), and 8 to the uncrowded container filled with reused water from the crowded group to simulate chemical cue exposure. Stress responses were assessed using a resazurin-based fluorescence assay (oxygen consumption) and righting time trials. The crowded group showed the highest average respiration rate (5.17 RFU/g/min), followed by uncrowded (4.72), uncrowded + crowded water (2.27), and control (1.63). Righting time was fastest in the control group (mean = 0.38 s) and slowest in the crowded group (1.45 s), which also showed the most variability. Median righting times were similar across all non-control groups. All mortality (n=3), limb loss (n = 2), and escape events (n=3) occurred in the crowded treatment. Salinity in the crowded tanks rose from 34 to 40-41 ppt, potentially adding osmotic stress. In contrast, chemical cue exposure (UC + CW) had little effect on righting time but was associated with reduced oxygen consumption, suggesting a possible suppression of metabolic activity rather than stress-induced elevation. Overall, physical crowding elevated physiological and behavioral stress metrics, while chemical cues alone had a subtler, possibly inhibitory effect on respiration. Future stuudies should control for crab age, size, and sex, and asses ammonia and pH levels to clarify these patterns. These findings highlight the physiological costs of crowding in intertidal species under habitat compression. Implementing living shorelines with soft, complex substrates and native vegetation that prevents erosion may reduce stress and promote reslience in species like H oregonensis and other intertidal or commercially valuable crabs such as H. oregonensis.
